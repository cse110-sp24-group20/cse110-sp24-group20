Welcome to the repository for Team 404, a stellar project group for CSE110 at UCSD! We are on a mission to create an out-of-this-world software development project. Join us as we navigate the cosmos of coding and teamwork.

## Introduction
*Welcome aboard space cadets!*<br>
Team 404 is committed to exploring the vast universe of software development. Out project inegrate a captivating space, offering a unique and engaging way for developers to document their journey. From designing galaxies of code to solving interstellar gugs, our project aims to provide a robust and immersive experience.

## Our Repository
Our repository is the command center of our project. Here's your mission briefing on its layout:
- `.github/`: Contains GitHub-specific files, such as workflows and issue templates.
- `.vscode/`: Configuration files for Visual Studio Code to ensure a consistent development environment.
- `__tests__`: Contains test files for ensuring the functionality and reliability of our code.
- `admin/`: Contains all administrative resources, including our Team 404 branding assets, CI/CD pipeline information, meeting notes, and weekly progress reports.
- `design in specs/`: Houses all our design boards for the homepage and each individual feature, created on Miro.
- `img/`: Contains useful elements & images like our emoticons, our backgrounds, the planets shown throughout the project, and other miscellaneous animations.
- `specs/`: Contains our ADRs, individual team member brainstorms, and our pitch slides.
- `src/`: The core of our project where all the source code resides. 

## Developer Journal

### Testing Utilized and General Build Process
To ensure our project remains stable and bug-free as it travels through the cosmos, we employ a rigorous testing and review process:

- **Jest Unit Testing**: Every component is tested to ensure it functions correctly.
- **Protected Main Branch**: All changes to the main branch require human review and testing. 
- **Codacy Automatic Review**: Our code is automatically reviewed for quality and consistency.
- **Dedicated PR Review Team**: A team of developers reviews all pull requests to maintain code integriity.
- **E2E Testing with Puppetteer**: End-to-end testing to simulate user interactions and ensure everything works as expected.

### Our Tools
- [Codacy Coverage]()
- [JDocs]()

### Fun Features
- **Senitment Widget**: One of the coolest features of our project is the integration of the sentiment widget we built at the beginning of the quarter. This animated widget allows users to select and edit their sentiment on the reflections page. It's not only a functional tool, but also a nod to how how team has grown and evolved over the course of the project.
- **Interactive Sceduling**: When you add events to the "Schedule Your Day" page, the events show up on the calendar in the "Schedule Your Month" page. Hovering over an event reveals the information you input (description, date, and time). The events are displayed in the corresponding color you chose and also indicate if you have completed the event based on whether you pressed the complete button in the "Schedule Your Day" page.
