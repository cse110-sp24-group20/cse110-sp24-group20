### Testing Utilized and General Build Process
To ensure our project remains stable and bug-free as it travels through the cosmos, we employ a rigourous testing and review process:

- **Jest Unit Testing**: Every component is tested to ensure it functions correctly.
- **Protected Main Branch**: All changes to the main branch require human review and testing. 
- **Codacy Automatic Review**: Our code is automatically reviewed for quality and consistency.
- **Dedicated PR Review Team**: A  team of developers reviews all pull requests to maintain code integriity.
- **E2E Testing with Puppetteer**: End-to-end testing to simulate user interactions and ensure everything works as expected.
