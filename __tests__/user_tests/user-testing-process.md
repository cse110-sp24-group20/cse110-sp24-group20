# User Testing Process Documentation

## Design User Testing Tasks
We made the user testing questions based on the 4 main features of our product - Developer’s Journal. There are two parts of the user test: task part and survey part. For the first part, we composed 10 tasks to cover all the interactive functions such as adding/deleting reflections, adding/deleting todo tasks, adding/tracking/deleting projects. Below is the full list of tasks we ask our user to perform(we informed them that we will record their working process):
1. Make a reflection on your day
2. Delete the reflection you made
3. Go back to the Home page
4. Add an event to your schedule of today
5. Mark it as “completed”
6. Delete the event you just completed
7. Add an event to your schedule of June 10th 10 a.m.
8. Check how many tasks you have for June 10th on the calendar
9. Add a project to track your progress
10.Mark complete of your progress for the project

After our users finish their tasks, we will no longer record their actions and they will move on to the survey questions. They can express about their experiences of doing the tasks, and they will probably provide us many useful suggestions on how to improve our product. Below are the full list of questions in the survey:
1. Any confusions you find when using the Developer’s Journal?
2. Any features you don’t like about and why?
3. Any functions you think are redundant and why?
4. Any appearances/visual components you don’t like about and why?
5. What are the features that you think are useful for a developer’s use but we don’t
cover it in our product?

## Conduct User Testing
We conducted this user test with three college students who need to code but never seen our product before, they could be one of our target group in the future. We recorded their testing process and answers to the survey for analysing purpose. The files are huge so we stored them in a google drive, this is the link for your convenience to view: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cn7ecWc0BFdRn4RITqi3h4SDGK3Is6zz?usp=share_link

## Analyse User Testing
Based on the feedback provided by the 3 users, we analysed the videos and their survey responses then found many improvements we can proceed. We made agenda for these improvements adn will conduct the user test again for the updated version of our product. This user testing model can also be expanded on scope if we further develop our product.
